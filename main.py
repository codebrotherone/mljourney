Based on : http://www.wildml.com/2015/09/implementing-a-neural-network-from-scratch/

To better understand how neural networks work, I should create one from scratch. Initially this tutorial doesn't
derive all functionality and takes some things for granted (data generation, as well as some of the `mathy` functions)

In time I hope to update everything that is required.
